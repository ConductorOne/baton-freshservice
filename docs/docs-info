While developing the connector, please fill out this form. This information is needed to write docs and to help other users set up the connector.

## Connector capabilities

1. What resources does the connector sync?
    This connector syncs:
        - Users (named as Agents) (users can be regular Agents or Requester Agents)
        - Groups (groups can be regular Groups or Requester Groups)
        - Roles

2. Can the connector provision any resources? If so, which ones?
    The connector can provision:
        - Roles for Users
        - Groups membership for Users

## Connector credentials

1. What credentials or information are needed to set up the connector? (For example, API key, client ID and secret, domain, etc.)
    This connector requires an API Key and a Domain. Args: --api-key and --domain

2. For each item in the list above:

   * How does a user create or look up that credential or info? Please include links to (non-gated) documentation, screenshots (of the UI or of gated docs), or a video of the process.
    To get the API Key:
        1.- Log in, then, on the top right corner of Freshservice's homepage, you should see an icon of a person.
        2.- Click on profile settings.
        3.- Complete the CAPTCHA to access your API key

    NOTE: if you can't see your API Key there, you should enable it for your user.
    For that:
        1.- While using an admin account, go to Admin Settings (gear icon on the bottom left).
        2.- Go to 'Agents' under the 'User Management' section.
        3.- Search for the Agent (user) that you want to enable the API Key for, and click on it. A more detailed view should be loaded. (don't click edit, click on the users name)
        4.- Go to the 'Permissions' tab.
        5.- Enable the Api Key.



   * Does the credential need any specific scopes or permissions? If so, list them here.
    For listing Users data, the following scope is required: [freshservice.agents.manage].
    For updating Users Roles, the same scope is required: [freshservice.agents.manage].
    For listing Groups, the scope: [freshservice.agentgroups.manage] is required.
    For updating Groups members, the scope [freshservice.agentgroups.manage] is required and it seems like the "Play God with Super Admin controls" privilege is also required.
    For listing Requesters Data (both Requester Agents and Requester Groups), the scope [freshservice.requesters.view] is required.
    To be able to modify Roles or Groups memberships for Requesters, the scope [freshservice.requesters.edit] is required.


   * If applicable: Is the list of scopes or permissions different to sync (read) versus provision (read-write)? If so, list the difference here.
    Same scopes. The following ones are required:
        freshservice.agents.manage
        freshservice.agentgroups.manage
        freshservice.requesters.view
        freshservice.requesters.edit

   * What level of access or permissions does the user need in order to create the credentials? (For example, must be a super administrator, must have access to the admin console, etc.)
    An admin user (Super Admin) can activate the API Keys for other users, and for himself.
